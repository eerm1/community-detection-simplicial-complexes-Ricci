# Community Detection on Simplicial Complexes with Discrete Ricci Flow

This repository implements community detection algorithms using discrete Ricci flow applied to simplicial complexes. The goal is to extend the Ricci flow-based methods, typically used in graphs, to more complex network structures that involve higher-order interactions (simplices).

## Installation
